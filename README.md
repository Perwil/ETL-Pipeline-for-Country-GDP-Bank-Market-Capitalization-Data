# 📊 ETL Pipeline for Country-GDP & Bank Market Capitalization Data

This project showcases a Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that processes financial data related to the world’s largest banks. The pipeline extracts bank market capitalization data from a public webpage, transforms it into multiple currencies using live exchange rates, and loads the final dataset into both a CSV file and a SQLite database. A series of queries are then executed on the database to derive insights.

## 🧠 About the Project

This project was developed as part of a **Python for Data Engineering** course. The goal was to simulate a real-world ETL task by:

- Extracting structured financial data from a Wikipedia page
- Enhancing the data using exchange rate conversion
- Loading the transformed data into persistent storage formats
- Executing SQL queries for quick analytics
